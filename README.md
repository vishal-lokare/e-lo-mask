# e-lo-mask
## Smart Mask for Smart People.
### Inspiration
We saw that the old masks had some drawbacks like too much tension on the ears and not being able to talk properly because of the tension being made by the mask.

### What it does
Our mask rules these problems out. We made a strap which can be connected to any mask and enable temperature sensing of the body and contact tracing with the nearby masks and other devices. 

### How we built it
We took the Arduino Nano development board and connected various components like thermopile temperature sensor for body's temperature sensing, and an adjustable temperature sensor for adjusting the temperature with the surroundings, and Bluetooth for contact tracing and logging the data to the smartphone.

### Challenges we ran into
Complexity and time were the constraints that came in the path of the project completion. Searching for the correct components which fit in the budget was also a big task.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We could successfully devise a method to make a working prototype of the project, just that we could not order the items because of the delivery time and could not test it on hardware.

### What we learned
We learned about workings of thermopile temperature sensor and learned a lot of new things about the electrical circuits used in the model.

### What's next for E Lo "Mask"
We could not test it on the hardware, so the first thing would be to test on hardware and implement the smartphone app which we thought of. The app will log the data of devices nearby and temperature throughout the day and show in a chart.
